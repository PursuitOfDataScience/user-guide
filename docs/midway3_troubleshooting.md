## Getting Started

### How do I become an RCC user?

RCC user account requests should be submitted via our online
application forms.  See [RCC Account Request](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/getting-started/request-account) for more information.

### How do I access RCC systems?

There are various ways to access RCC systems.

To access Midway2 interactively, use ThinLinc or an SSH client. See
[Connecting to RCC Resources](../connecting/index.md#connecting) for details.

To access files stored on Midway2, use scp, Globus Online or
SAMBA. See [Data Transfer](../data-transfer/index.md#data-transfer) for details.

### How do I request access to a PI’s account if I already have an account on Midway?

Please submit a [User Account Request](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/general-user-account-request) and provide your
[CNetID](https://itservices.uchicago.edu/services/cnetid) and the PI Account name (typically `pi-` followed by the
CNetID of the PI). The PI will receive an automated email requesting
authorization for this request.

### What is my RCC username and password?

The RCC uses the University of Chicago CNetIDs for user credentials. Once
your RCC account is created, your RCC username and password will be the
same as your CNetID credentials.

### Can an external collaborator get a CNetID so they can log in to RCC?

The RCC can create CNetIDs for external collaborators. See [RCC
Account Request](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/getting-started/request-account) for more information.

### What should I do if I left the university and my CNetID password no longer works?

You can use your CNetID for authentication after you have left, but IT
Services may expire it when you leave. If you have an RCC account, but
you still can’t log in, it is likely that password authentication has
been disabled by IT Services. Please contact [help@rcc.uchicago.edu](mailto:help@rcc.uchicago.edu) to
request re-enabling access to your account.

### How do I change/reset my password?

The RCC cannot change or reset your password. Go to the [CNet Password
Recovery](https://cnet.uchicago.edu/recertify/) page to change or reset your password.

### What groups am I a member of?

To list the groups you are a member of, type `groups` on any RCC system.

### How do I access the data visualization lab in the Zar room of Crerar Library?

The Zar room and its visualization equipment can be reserved for
events, classes, or visualization work by contacting the RCC at
[help@rcc.uchicago.edu](mailto:help@rcc.uchicago.edu). More information regarding the RCC’s visualization
facilities can be found on the [RCC Data Visualization](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/resources/visualization) page.

### What login shells are supported and how do I change my default shell?

The RCC supports the following shells:


* **/bin/bash**


* **/bin/tcsh**


* **/bin/zsh**

Use this command to change your default shell:

```default
$ chsh -s /path/to/shell
```

It may take up to 30 minutes for that change to take effect.

### Is remote access with Mosh supported?

Yes. To use [Mosh](http://mosh.mit.edu), first log in to Midway via
SSH, and add the command **module load mosh** to your
~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshenv if you use zsh). Then, you can log in by
entering the following command in a terminal window:

```default
$ mosh <CNetID>@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu
```

### Is SSH key authentication allowed on RCC machines?

No.

### Why am I getting “ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer” when I try to log in via SSH ?

You can get this error if you incorrectly enter your password too many
times. This is a security measure that is in place to limit the
ability for malicious users to use brute force SSH attacks against our
systems.

After 3 failed password entry attempts, an IP address will be blocked for 4
hours.

While you wait for the block to be lifted, you should still be able to
access Midway2 using ThinLinc.

### Why am I getting prompted for YubiKey when I try to log in via SSH ?

There are few reasons to get that error message. Please enroll in two factor authentication if you have not done already by
visiting [https://2fa.rcc.uchicago.edu](https://2fa.rcc.uchicago.edu). Please make sure you run `ssh -Y your_cnetID@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu`. Finally, please
make sure your Midway account has not been expired.

## Allocations

### What is an allocation?

An allocation is a specified number of computing and storage resources
granted to a PI or education account. An allocation is necessary to
run jobs on RCC systems.  See [RCC Allocations](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/getting-started/request-allocation) for more details.

### What is a service unit (SU)?

A service unit (SU) is roughly equal to 1 core-hour; for a more
precise definition, see [RCC Service Units](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/getting-started/user-guidelines).

### How do I obtain an allocation?

The RCC accepts proposals for large (“Research II”) allocations
bi-annually. Medium-sized allocations, special purpose allocations
for time-critical research, and allocations for education and outreach
may be submitted at any time. See [RCC Allocations](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/getting-started/request-allocation) for more
information.

### How is compute cluster usage charged to my account?

The charge associated with a job on Midway2 is a function of (1) the
number of cores allocated to the job, and (2) the elapsed wall-clock
time (in hours).

### How do I check the balance of my allocation?

The `rcchelp` tool is the easiest way to check your account
balance.

```default
$ rcchelp balance
```

### How do I check how my allocation has been used?

The `rcchelp` tool has several options for summarizing allocation usage. For a summary, run

```default
$ rcchelp usage
```

To see usage per job, run

```default
$ rcchelp usage --byjob
```

If you are the PI, you may use `--byuser` option to see your group members’ individual usage

```default
$ rcchelp usage --byuser
```

## Software

### What software does RCC offer on its compute systems?

Software available within the RCC environment is constantly
evolving. We regularly install new software, and new versions of
existing software. Information about available software and how to use
specific software pacakges can be found in the [Software](../software/index.md#software) section
of the User Guide.

To view the current list of installed software on Midway2, run

```default
$ module avail
```

To view the list of available versions for a specific software, run

```default
$ module avail <software>
```

### How do I get help with RCC software?

Documentation for many program can be viewed with the following
command.

```default
$ man <command>
```

Many programs also provide documentation through command-line options
such as `--help` or `-h`. For example,

```default
$ module load gcc
$ gcc --help
```

RCC also maintains supplementary documentation for software specific
to our systems. Consult the [Software](../software/index.md#software) page for more information.

### Why is my favorite command not available?

Most likely it is because you have not loaded the appropriate software
module. Most software packages are only available after first loading
the appropriate software module. See [Software](../software/index.md#software) for more
information on how to access pre-installed software on RCC systems.

### Why do I get an error that says a module cannot be loaded due to a conflict?

Occassionally, modules are incompatible with each other and cannot be
loaded simultaneously. The module command typically gives you hints
about which previously loaded module conflicts with the one you are
trying to load. If you see such an error, try unloading a module with
this command:

```default
$ module unload <module-name>
```

### How do I request installation of a new or updated software package?

Please send email to [help@rcc.uchicago.edu](mailto:help@rcc.uchicago.edu) with the details of your
software request, including what software package you need and which
version of the software you prefer.

### Why can’t I run Gaussian?

Gaussian’s creators have historically had a strict usage policy, so we
have limited its availability on RCC systems. If you need to use
Gaussian for your research, please contact [help@rcc.uchicago.edu](mailto:help@rcc.uchicago.edu) to
request access.

## Cluster Usage

### How do I submit a job to the queue?

RCC systems use [Slurm](http://slurm.schedmd.com) to manage resources and job queues. For
advice on how to run specific types of jobs, consult the
[Running jobs on midway](../running-jobs/index.md#running-jobs) section of the User Guide.

### Can I login directly to a compute node?

You can start up an interactive session on a compute node with the
`sinteractive` command. This command takes the same arguments as
`sbatch`.  More information about interactive jobs, see
[Interactive Jobs](../using-midway/index.md#interactive-jobs).

### How do I run jobs in parallel?

There are many ways to configure parallel jobs—the best approach
will depend on your software and resource requirements. For more
information on two commonly used approaches, see [Parallel batch jobs](../running-jobs/srun-parallel/index.md#parallel-batch)
and [Job arrays](../running-jobs/array/index.md#array-jobs).

### Are there any limits to running jobs on Midway2?

Run `rcchelp qos` on Midway to view the current criteria.

### I am a member of multiple accounts. How do I choose which allocation is charged?

If you belong to multiple accounts, jobs will get charged to your
default account unless you specify the `--account=<account>` option
when you submit a job with `sbatch`.

Run this command to determine your default account.

```default
sacctmgr list user $USER
```

To change your default account, run this command.

```default
sacctmgr modify user $USER set defaultaccount=<account>
```

Alternatively, you may request the change by contacting the RCC.

### Why is my job not starting?

This could be due to a variety of factors. Running
`squeue --user=<userid>` can will help to find the answer; see in
particular the **NODELIST(REASON)** column in the squeue output. A job
that is waiting in the queue may show one of the following labels in this
column:


* **(Priority)**: Other jobs currently have higher priority than your job.


* **(Resources)**: Your job has enough priority to run, but there
aren’t yet enough free resources to run it.


* **(QOSResourceLimit)**: Your job exceeds the QOS limits. The QOS
limits include wall time, number of jobs a user can have running at
once, number of nodes a user can use at once, and so on. For
example, if you are at or near the limit of number of jobs that can
be run at once, your job will become eligible to run as soon as
other jobs finish.

Please contact RCC support if you believe that your job is not being
handled correctly by the Slurm queuing system.

Also, note that if you see a large number of jobs that aren’t running
when many resources are idle, it is possible that RCC staff have
scheduled an upcoming maintenance window. In this case, any jobs
requesting a wall time that overlaps with the maintenance window will
remain in the queue until after the maintainence period is over. The
RCC staff will typically notify users via email prior to performing a
maintenance and after a maintenance is completed.

### Why does my job fail after a few seconds?

This is most likely because there is an error in your job submission
script, or because the program you are trying to run is producing
an error and terminating prematurely.

If you need help troubleshooting the issue, please send your job
submission script, as well as the error generated by your job
submission script, to [help@rcc.uchicago.edu](mailto:help@rcc.uchicago.edu).

### Why does my job fail with message “exceeded memory limit, being killed”?

On the main midway2 partition, `broadwl`, Slurm allocates 2 GB of
memory per allocated CPU by default. If your computations require more
than the default amount, you should adjust the memory allocated to
your job with the `--mem` or `--mem-per-cpu` flags. For
example, to request 10 cores and 40 GB of memory on a broadwl node,
include these options when running sbatch or sinteractive:
`--ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=10 --mem=40G`.

### Why does my sinteractive job fail with “Connection to <host> closed.”?

There are two likely explanations for this error.

One possibility is that you are over the time limit. The default walltime for
sinteractive is 2 hours. This can be increased by including the
`--time` flag to your sinteractive call.

Another possiblity is that your job exceeded the memory limit. You can
resolve this by requesting additional memory using `--mem` or
`--mem-per-cpu`.

### How do I run jobs that need to run longer than the maximum wall time?

The RCC queuing system is designed to provide fair resource allocation
to all RCC users. The maximum wall time is intended to prevent
individual users from using more than their fair share of cluster
resources.

If you have specific computing tasks that cannot be solved with the
current constraints, please submit a special request for resources to
[help@rcc.uchicago.edu](mailto:help@rcc.uchicago.edu).

### Can I create a cron job?

The RCC does not support users creating cron jobs. However, it is possible
to use Slurm to submit “cron-like” jobs. See [Cron-like jobs](../running-jobs/cron/index.md#cron-jobs) for more
information.

## Performance and Coding

### What compilers does the RCC support?

The RCC supports the GNU, Intel, PGI and NVidia’s CUDA compilers.

### Which versions of MPI does RCC support?

The RCC maintains OpenMPI, IntelMPI, and MVAPICH2 compilers. See
[Message Passing Interface (MPI)](../software/libraries/mpi/index.md#mpi-libraries) for more information and instructions for using
these MPI frameworks.

### Can the RCC help me parallelize and optimize my code?

The RCC support staff are available to consult with you or your
research team to help parallelize and optimize your code for use on
RCC systems.  Contact the RCC staff at [help@rcc.uchicago.edu](mailto:help@rcc.uchicago.edu) to set up
a consultation.

### Does RCC provide GPU computing resources?

Yes. The RCC high-performance systems provide GPU-equipped
compute nodes. For instructions on using the GPU nodes, see
[GPU jobs](../running-jobs/gpu/index.md#gpu-computing).

## File I/O, Storage, and Transfers

### How much storage space do I have?

Use the `quota` command to get a summary of your current file system
usage and available storage space.

### How do I get my storage quota increased?

Additional storage space can be purchased through the [Cluster
Partnership Program](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/cluster-partnership-program). You may also request additional storage as part
of a [Research II Allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/research-allocation-request-II) or [Special Allocation](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/special-allocation-request).

### How do I share files with others?

The recommended way to share files with members of your group is to
store them in the `/project` or `/project2` directory for your
group. Project directories are created for all PI and project
accounts. File and directory permissions can be customized to allow
access to users within the group, as well as RCC users that do not
belong to your group.

### I accidentally deleted or lost a file. How do I restore it?

The best way to recover a recently deleted, corrupted or lost file is
from a snapshot. See [Data Recovery and Backups](../data-storage/index.md#data-recovery) for more information.

### How do I request a restore of my files from tape backup?

The RCC maintains tape backups of all home and project directories.
These tape backups are intended for disaster recovery purposes only.
There is no long-term history of files on tape. In most cases, you
should use file system snapshots to retrieve recover files.  See
[Data Recovery and Backups](../data-storage/index.md#data-recovery) for more information.
